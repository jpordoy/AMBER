## AMBER Model
# Introduction
The AMVER (Automated Multimodal Vital Event Recognition) model is a deep learning-based system designed for vital event recognition from sensor data. This model leverages a Parallel Attention Network (PANN) architecture to efficiently process multimodal sensor data and classify vital events.

Features
Multimodal sensor data processing
Parallel Attention Network architecture
Classification of vital events
